# Sentiment Analysis for Marketing

## Overview

This project provides a sentiment analysis tool to analyze customer sentiment for marketing purposes. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate text data and determine whether it conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the sentiment analysis code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/nithishmohan9/naanmuthalvanphase1.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-marketing
   

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   bash
   python -m venv venv
   

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     

   - On macOS and Linux:

     bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     

5. Install the required Python packages:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

6. Download the sentiment analysis model (if not already included in the repository) and place it in the models directory.

### Usage

1. Prepare your text data for sentiment analysis. You can provide input data as a CSV file, a text file, or by using an API, depending on your specific use case.

2. Modify the config.ini file to configure the input data source, model parameters, and output options.

3. Run the sentiment analysis script:

   bash
   python analyze_sentiment.py
   

4. The sentiment analysis results will be saved to the specified output location as defined in the config.ini file.

### Configuration

You can configure the sentiment analysis by modifying the config.ini file. This file contains the following sections:

- **[Data]**: Specify the input data source and format.
- **[Model]**: Configure model settings, such as the path to the sentiment analysis model.
- **[Output]**: Define where the results will be saved.

## Data Source

For this sentiment analysis project in marketing, you can use a variety of data sources to analyze customer sentiment. The choice of data source depends on your specific marketing needs, but common sources include:

- Social Media Feeds: Extract text data from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to understand how customers are discussing your brand, products, or services.

- Customer Reviews: Analyze customer reviews from e-commerce websites, review platforms, and online marketplaces. These reviews often contain valuable insights into customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.

- Surveys and Feedback Forms: Collect and analyze text feedback from customer surveys, questionnaires, and feedback forms to gauge customer satisfaction and identify pain points.

- Email Communication: Analyze the sentiment expressed in customer emails, which can provide insights into individual customer experiences and concerns.

- Chat Logs: If you have customer support chat logs, you can use sentiment analysis to assess customer satisfaction during support interactions.

## Description

Sentiment analysis is a crucial tool in marketing that allows businesses to gain valuable insights into how their customers perceive their brand, products, and services. Here's a brief description of sentiment analysis in marketing:

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to automatically determine the sentiment expressed in text data. In the context of marketing, sentiment analysis helps businesses:

- Monitor Brand Reputation: By analyzing social media mentions and online reviews, companies can track public sentiment about their brand, products, and services. This information is essential for maintaining a positive brand image and addressing negative feedback promptly.

- Customer Feedback Analysis: Sentiment analysis can help businesses assess the sentiment of customer feedback, such as surveys, reviews, and emails. This allows organizations to identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions.

- Competitor Analysis: Analyzing sentiment in public discussions can provide insights into how customers perceive your competitors. This information can be used to gain a competitive edge in the market.

- Marketing Campaign Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns by analyzing customer reactions and feedback. Sentiment analysis helps marketers understand what resonates with their audience and what doesn't.

- Customer Support Insights: Analyzing the sentiment in customer support interactions, such as chat logs and emails, enables businesses to improve customer service and address issues proactively.

- Product Development: Customer sentiment can guide product development by identifying features or aspects that customers love or dislike.

In this project, we provide a tool that leverages sentiment analysis to help marketing professionals gain actionable insights from text data, enabling data-driven marketing decisions and improving customerÂ satisfaction.
