Certainly, here's a sample README file for a sentiment analysis codebase tailored for marketing. You can use this as a template and modify it as needed for your specific project:

# Sentiment Analysis for Marketing

## Overview

This project provides a sentiment analysis tool to analyze customer sentiment for marketing purposes. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate text data and determine whether it conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the sentiment analysis code on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/nithishmohan9/naanmuthalvanphase1.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   bash
   cd sentiment-analysis-marketing
   

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):

   bash
   python -m venv venv
   

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     

   - On macOS and Linux:

     bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     

5. Install the required Python packages:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

6. Download the sentiment analysis model (if not already included in the repository) and place it in the models directory.

### Usage

1. Prepare your text data for sentiment analysis. You can provide input data as a CSV file, a text file, or by using an API, depending on your specific use case.

2. Modify the config.ini file to configure the input data source, model parameters, and output options.

3. Run the sentiment analysis script:

   bash
   python analyze_sentiment.py
   

4. The sentiment analysis results will be saved to the specified output location as defined in the config.ini file.

### Configuration

You can configure the sentiment analysis by modifying the config.ini file. This file contains the following sections:

- **[Data]**: Specify the input data source and format.
- **[Model]**: Configure model settings, such as the path to the sentiment analysis model.
- **[Output]**: Define where the results will be saved.
